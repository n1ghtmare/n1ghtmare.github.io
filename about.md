Hi, I'm Dimitar.

I have been working full time as a software engineer since 2007. Most of my time I spend working on complex enterprise software. Over the years, I've developed a very strong passion for computers and technology. I got my first computer when I was 7 years old, and I have been writing code ever since. I enjoy dabbing into new technologies and getting out of my comfort zone. This is my personal blog. I use it to share my experiences, reflect on things and document my journey into software development.
